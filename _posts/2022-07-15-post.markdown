Honey bees and pesticides are both vital to food security--so how do we ensure that one isn't harmed by the other?

To help address this problem, we used graph kernel transformations and support vector machines to produce a model capable of predicting whether a molecular structure is likely to be acutely toxic to bees.  Read the [paper][paper] at the Journal of Chemical Physics, and check out the code on [GitHub][github]. You can also listen to an interview with my coauthor and me on Oregon State University's [PolliNation podcast][podcast].
